Valentine Shopping
Max. Marks 100
As it is the Valentines month, Puchi's girlfriend asks him to take her shopping. He, being the average bloke, does not have a lot of money to spend. Hence, decides to buy each item from the shop that offers the best price on it. His girlfriend wants to buy N items. Each item is available on M shops .
Being the Valentine Season, shops have the products on a discounted price. But, the discounts are in the form of successive discounts. Each shop has a successive discount of order-3 on each of the N products. 

Find, for each item, the shop that offers the best price on it. You may assume that the base price of each item is same on all shops.
Note: 
A successive discount of 25% and 50% on an item of Rs 1000, means getting a discount of 50% on the new price, after getting a discount of 25% on original price, i.e item is available at Rs 750 after a 25% discount , and successively at Rs 375 after two successive discounts of 25 and 50.

Input:
First line contains T the number of test cases. T test cases follow. First line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M , the number of items and the number of shops respectively. It is followed by description of N products. Each product description consists of M lines with 3 integers each, the successive discounts offered on that product.

Output:
Print N space separated integers i.e for the i'th product, print the index (1<=index<=M) of the shop that offers the best price for that product.
In case of multiple shops offering the same discount, output the one with lower index.

Constraints: 
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 1000
0 ≤ Discounts ≤ 100
