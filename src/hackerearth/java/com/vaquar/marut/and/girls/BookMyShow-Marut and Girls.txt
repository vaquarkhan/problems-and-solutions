Max. Marks 100
Marut is now a well settled person. Impressed by the coding skills of Marut, N girls wish to marry him. Marut will consider marriage proposals of only those girls who have some special qualities. Qualities are represented by positive non-zero integers.

Marut has a list of M qualities which he wants in a girl. He can also consider those girls who have some extra qualities, provided they have at least all those qualities which Marut wants.

Find how many girls' proposal will Marut consider. 

Input:
First line contains the integer M, denoting the number of qualities which Marut wants.
Next line contains M single space separated distinct integers.
Third line contains an integer N, denoting the number of girls.
Next follow N lines, ith line contains few single-space separated distinct integers, denoting the qualities of the ith girl.

Output:
Print the number of girls, whose proposals will be considered by Marut.

1 ≤ M ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 9 x 103
1 ≤ Maximum no. of qualities possessed by girls ≤ 1000.
Qualities are positive non-zero integers such that 1 ≤ Quality ≤ 104
