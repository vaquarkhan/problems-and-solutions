Trace of a matrix
Max. Marks 100
Given Two matrix A and B of some order RXC. Both matrix contains elements from 1 to R*C . Matrix A contains elements in Row-major order while Matrix B contains elements in Column-major order .you are asked to answer a very simple question what is the trace of the matrix formed by the addition of A and B. Here, Trace of the matrix is defined as P[1][1] + P[2][2]... + P[min(n,m)][min(n,m)] for any rectangular matrix P.

Input:

First line of input contains T denoting number of test cases. Each test case consists of single line only containing two integers denoting order of matrix R and C.

Output:

Output consists of T lines each containing answer to the corresponding test cases.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 105
1 ≤ R,C ≤ 106

Explanation
For first input , the two matrices A and B will be :

    1 2 3 
A = 4 5 6 
    7 8 9

    1 4 7
B = 2 5 8
    3 6 9

      2 6 10
A+B = 6 10 14
     10 14 18
There , the trace of (A+B) matrix is 2 + 10 + 18 = 30

Similarly , answer can be found for the second input also.
